# KSGPPI: 
Improving Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction using Protein Language Model and Protein Network Features.

## Pre-requisite:
    - Python3,Pytorch
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - sklearn
    - networkx
    - esm
    - Linux system 

## Installation:

*Install and configure the softwares of Python3. Please make sure that python3 includes the modules of 'os', 'math', 'numpy', 'random', 'subprocess', 'sys', 'torch' and 'shutil'. If any one modules does not exist, please using 'pip3 install XXXX' command install the python revelant module. Here, "XXXX" is one module name.

*Download this repository at  https://github.com/rickleezhe/KSGPPI for academic use. Then, uncompress it and run the following command lines on Linux System.
